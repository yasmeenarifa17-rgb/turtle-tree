🌸 Turtle Tree Drawing – Python Turtle Project
This project uses Python's Turtle Graphics and a bit of randomness to draw a beautiful, fractal-style pink tree. The tree is generated automatically with branching angles and lengths that give it a natural, artistic look.
This project helped me practice:
-python basics
-Turtle graphics
-Functions
-Recursion
-Creative coding

✨ Features

-Automatically draws a colorful tree

-Uses recursion for natural branching

-Customizable angles, branch length, and colors

-Uses Turtle Graphics (built-in Python module)

-Beginner-friendly — easy to understand and modify

📁 Project Structure

turtle_tree.py   # Main Python script
README.md        # Project documentation

🛠️ Technologies Used

-Python 3

-Turtle Graphics module

-Random module for natural variations


▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Install Python

Download Python from
https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Clone or download this repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

Or download ZIP manually.

3. Run the script

python turtle_tree.py

The Turtle window will open and start drawing the tree automatically.


🌳 Code Explanation (Simple)

The script starts by:

1.Setting up the Turtle window

3.Positioning the turtle at the bottom

3.Using a recursive function (draw_branch) to draw smaller and smaller branches

4.Random angles and branch length reduction make every tree look unique
